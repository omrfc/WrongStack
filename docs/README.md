# WrongStack Documentation

This is the on-ramp to the WrongStack documentation. If you're new to the project, start with the [Architecture](#architecture) section to get the big picture, then jump to the relevant [Author Guide](#author-guides) if you're adding a tool, plugin, provider, or help module.

| Guide | What it covers | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| [tool-author-guide.md](tool-author-guide.md) | How to write a WrongStack tool (the agent's hands): `Tool<I, O>` interface, permission policy, risk tier, streaming | Adding a new file / bash / network / domain tool |

## Subcommand Reference

Per-subcommand documentation. Each entry in `docs/subcommands/` documents one subcommand in the `wstack <sub>` form.

| `bench` | [subcommands/bench.md](subcommands/bench.md) |
| `diag` / `doctor` | [subcommands/diag-doctor.md](subcommands/diag-doctor.md) |
| `export` | [subcommands/export.md](subcommands/export.md) |
| `mcp` | [subcommands/mcp.md](subcommands/mcp.md) |

For an index, see [subcommands/README.md](subcommands/README.md).

---

## Slash Command Reference

Per-slash-command documentation. Each entry in `docs/slash/` documents one slash command in the `/<cmd>` form (used in the REPL).

For the full index, see [slash/README.md](slash/README.md), which lists every built-in slash command with its source file and a one-line description.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture significant architectural decisions, the alternatives considered, and the reasons. They're the historical record for "why is it this way?".

| ADR | Date | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| [adr-001-layer-instead-of-split.md](adr/adr-001-layer-instead-of-split.md) | 2026-05-20 | Accepted | Rejected extracting `@wrongstack/kernel` as a separate package; kept everything in `@wrongstack/core` with strict internal layering + automated enforcement |
| [adr-002-help-delegation-pattern.md](adr/adr-002-help-delegation-pattern.md) | 2026-06-15 | Accepted (audit predictions confirmed) | Added `customBody?: () => string` to `PerSubcommandHelp`; the canonical pattern for help modules that don't fit the standard layout |

**For new ADRs**: use `docs/adr/adr-NNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded, kebab-case). The on-ramp for the help-delegation pattern is [help-modules.md](help-modules.md); the ADR is the historical record.

## Conventions

- **Markdown formatting**: ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`), fenced code blocks with language tags, two-space indent, 100-char soft wrap. See [typescript-style-guide.md](typescript-style-guide.md) for code style.
- **Cross-references**: use relative links (`[text](file.md)`) so docs render correctly on GitHub and in editors.
- **Code paths**: reference files with their full path from the repo root in backticks (e.g. `` `packages/cli/src/subcommands/handlers/per-subcommand-help.ts` ``).
- **New docs**: drop them in the right category (or create a new category if needed). Add a row to the appropriate table in this README so the index stays current.

---

## Contributing

1. **Read the [architecture.md](architecture.md)** for the package layout and layering rules.
2. **Read the relevant Author Guide** for the surface you're adding (tool, plugin, provider, help module).
3. **Read the [typescript-style-guide.md](typescript-style-guide.md)** before writing code.
4. **Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test`** before opening a PR. Both are required to pass.
5. **Update this README** when you add a new document to a category, or when you create a new category.

For questions, the [`/help` slash command](slash/help.md) and the [`wstack <sub> --help`](subcommands/version-help.md) surfaces are the canonical in-product references. Anything not covered by the in-product help is either a bug or a missing doc.
