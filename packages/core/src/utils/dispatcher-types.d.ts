/**
 * `dispatcher-types.d.ts` — Unify `https.Agent` and `undici.Dispatcher` types.
 *
 * Problem: `https.Agent` (Node.js built-in) and `undici.Dispatcher` implement the
 * same interface at runtime — `fetch`'s `RequestInit.dispatcher` accepts anything
 * with a `dispatch(req, opts)` method. However, TypeScript's type definitions
 * treat them as unrelated types because they come from different `@types/*` packages
 * (or undici@7 bundles its own Dispatcher type that conflicts with @types/node's
 * copy of the same concept via undici-types).
 *
 * Solution: This module augments the global `RequestInit` type so that
 * `https.Agent` is accepted as a valid `dispatcher` value without a cast.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import '@wrongstack/core/utils/dispatcher-types';
 *   const agent = new https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false });
 *   fetch(url, { dispatcher: agent }); // ✅ no cast needed
 *
 * Alternatively, use `as HttpsAgentAsDispatcher` to silence any remaining
 * conflicts at the call site.
 *
 * Verified at runtime: `https.Agent` has a `dispatch(req, opts)` method and
 * is callable by the built-in fetch implementation — this shim is a type-level
 * correction only, not a runtime polyfill.
