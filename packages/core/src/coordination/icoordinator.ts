/**
 * Interface for a fleet coordinator. Implemented by both `Director`
 * (full LLM-driven orchestration with fleet policy) and
 * `DefaultMultiAgentCoordinator` (direct API-driven, no fleet policy).
 *
 * External callers — CLI slash commands, tests, the delegate tool —
 * use this to stay agnostic to the orchestration mode.
 *
 * The interface captures the **orchestration contract**: spawn, assign,
 * terminate, await, and query. Fleet-level policy (cost caps, manifest
 * writing, checkpointing) lives behind this surface and is optional
 * from the caller's perspective.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * let coordinator: ICoordinator = isDirectorMode
 *   ? new Director({ config, ... })
 *   : new DefaultMultiAgentCoordinator(config);
 * const id = await coordinator.spawn({ name: 'worker', role: 'researcher' });
 * await coordinator.assign({ id: 't-1', description: 'research X', subagentId: id });
 * const results = await coordinator.awaitTasks(['t-1']);
 * ```
