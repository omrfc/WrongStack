  /**
   * Wall-clock / idle budget check. Delegates to `checkLimits(elapsed)`, so
   * `timeout` and `idle_timeout` follow the SAME negotiation path as the other
   * kinds — they are NOT a special-cased hard stop. This is deliberate: a
   * heartbeat-aware policy (see `attachAutoExtend` and `CollabSession`) grants
   * a timeout extension only while the agent is making progress and denies it
   * once the agent is genuinely stuck, which is safer than an unconditional
   * hard kill of a long-but-working agent. The runner translates the resulting
   * `BudgetThresholdSignal` decision (`extend` → patch limits in place,
   * `stop` → abort) just like every other kind.
   *
   * Decision table (same as `checkLimits`):
   * - no `onThreshold` handler        → throw `BudgetExceededError` (hard stop)
   * - `mode === 'sync'`               → throw `BudgetExceededError` (hard stop)
   * - `mode === 'auto'` + no listener → throw `BudgetExceededError` (no one to ask)
   * - `mode === 'auto'` + listener    → throw `BudgetThresholdSignal` (negotiated;
   *                                     a heartbeat-aware policy may extend the timeout)
