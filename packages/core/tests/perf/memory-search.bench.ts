/**
 * Locks in the O(1) exact-lookup fast path in `searchIndex`.
 *
 * Before the fix, every query needle walked the ENTIRE vocabulary
 * (`for (const [word] of wordMap)`), making search O(needles × vocabulary) —
 * it scaled linearly with how much memory had accumulated. The fix tries an
 * exact `Map.get(needle)` first and only falls back to a bounded substring
 * scan when there's no exact hit AND the needle is ≥ 3 chars.
 *
 * The key invariant these benches protect: an **exact whole-word** query must
 * cost roughly the same whether the index holds 1K or 10K distinct words. If
 * someone reintroduces the full-vocabulary walk, the 10K/exact bench will
 * blow out relative to the 1K/exact bench. The substring-fallback bench is
 * included as the deliberate worst case for contrast.
