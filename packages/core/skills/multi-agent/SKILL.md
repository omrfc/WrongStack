# Multi-Agent Coordination — WrongStack

## Overview

Coordinates parallel AI agent execution for tasks that benefit from fanning out. Leader delegates narrow subtasks to workers, collects structured results, and synthesizes a unified output.

## Rules

1. Subagents share nothing — no memory, no session state, no variable scope.
2. Leader must aggregate results — don't let worker output go unprocessed.
3. Narrow task scope per subagent — broad tasks cause `budget_exhausted`.
4. Role must match task — don't use `bug-hunter` to write docs.
5. Check `stopReason` on every result: `end_turn` (clean), `budget_exhausted` (retry), `error` (surface), `aborted` (don't retry).
6. Don't fan out single atomic tasks under 5 tool calls — overhead exceeds benefit.

## Patterns

### Do

```typescript
// ✅ Good — narrow, focused task per subagent
batch_tool_use([
  { tool: "delegate", input: { task: "Audit auth/session.ts for null-deref bugs", role: "bug-hunter" }},
  { tool: "delegate", input: { task: "Audit auth/token.ts for null-deref bugs", role: "bug-hunter" }},
  { tool: "delegate", input: { task: "Audit auth/refresh.ts for null-deref bugs", role: "bug-hunter" }},
])

// ✅ Leader passes artifact explicitly
// Subagent B gets subagent A's output as part of the task description
```

### Don't

```typescript
// ❌ Bad — too broad, will exhaust budget
{ task: "Audit all packages for bugs" }

// ❌ Bad — no aggregation
// Subagents return results, leader pastes raw output without synthesis

// ❌ Bad — role mismatch
{ task: "Write documentation for the API", role: "bug-hunter" }
```

## When to fan out

✅ Good fits:
- "Audit these 50 files for X" — one subagent per chunk of 5-10 files
- "Run tests in all 12 packages" — parallel `pnpm test` across packages
- "Refactor 3 independent modules" — separate agents for each
- "Review this PR + check the tests + check docs" — three parallel workers

❌ Avoid:
- Single atomic task under 5 tool calls — overhead exceeds benefit
- Tasks requiring shared state — subagents have isolated contexts
- Long sequential dependencies — chain within one agent, don't fan out

## Roles

| Role | Responsibility | Tools |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **Leader** | Coordinates, delegates, synthesizes | `delegate`, `plan`, `read` |
| **Worker** | Executes a narrow subtask | Any needed tools |
| **Reviewer** | Validates worker output, approves/rejects | `grep`, `test`, `read` |
| **Architect** | Makes design decisions when workers hit ambiguity | `read`, `glob`, `grep` |

## Delegation patterns

### One-shot fan-out (all workers in one turn)

```
batch_tool_use([
  { tool: "delegate", input: { task: "Audit auth/session.ts for null-deref bugs", role: "bug-hunter" }},
  { tool: "delegate", input: { task: "Audit auth/token.ts for null-deref bugs", role: "bug-hunter" }},
  { tool: "delegate", input: { task: "Audit auth/refresh.ts for null-deref bugs", role: "bug-hunter" }},
])
```

### Fleet pattern (stateful, multiple turns)

```
delegate → spawn N subagents → assign_task per subagent → await_tasks
```

Use this when the task has dependencies — subagent 2 waits for subagent 1's artifact.

## Communication

Workers return structured results. Read `stopReason`:
- `end_turn` — clean finish, check `result`
- `budget_exhausted` — task too broad, narrow and retry
- `error` — infrastructure issue, surface it to user
- `aborted` — user cancelled, don't retry silently

## Result aggregation

Leader collects and synthesizes:

```
For each worker result:
  - Extract key findings (don't just paste raw output)
  - Deduplicate (multiple workers may find the same issue)
  - Prioritize: critical > high > medium > low
  - Present as unified report
```

## Anti-patterns

- **Over-delegation**: Firing 50 subagents in one turn — model context explodes, nothing gets done
- **Under-delegation**: One agent doing everything — defeats the purpose, burns budget
- **Role mismatch**: Using `bug-hunter` to write documentation, or `refactor-planner` for security audits
- **Result loss**: Subagents return useful data but leader doesn't aggregate — always check `result`
- **Silent failure**: `budget_exhausted` subagent output ignored — partial results are still results

## Context sharing

Subagents share **nothing** — no memory, no session state, no variable scope. If subagent B needs output from subagent A, the leader must pass it explicitly as part of the task description or pass it via a shared file the leader writes before delegating.

## Skills in scope

- `bug-hunter` — parallel file audits
- `security-scanner` — parallel security scans
- `refactor-planner` — parallel module analysis
- `audit-log` — aggregating multiple session analyses

## collab_debug — Three-Agent Parallel Code Review

`collab_debug` runs **BugHunter + RefactorPlanner + Critic** simultaneously on the same file snapshot. All three agents receive the full target context, so the number of files must be kept small.

### Target size limit: dynamic, defaults to 30

The file limit is computed in this priority order:

1. **`maxTargetFiles`** — explicit override if provided
2. **`contextWindow`** — dynamic calculation: `floor((contextWindow × 0.4) / 2000)`
3. **`DEFAULT_MAX_TARGET_FILES = 30`** — fallback when neither is set

Each of the three agents gets the entire file snapshot as context. With 3 agents × N files, large targets cause:
- **Token overflow** — context window exhausted
- **Timeout failures** — session times out before agents finish
- **Budget exhaustion** — each agent burns through iterations with no progress

| contextWindow (tokens) | Calculated limit | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| 200_000 (large model) | 40 files | ~20-30 recommended |
| 100_000 (typical) | 20 files | ✅ Comfortable |
| 32_768 (small) | 6 files | ⚠️ Very limited |
| not provided | 30 files (default) | Safe baseline |

The session throws a clear error if the resolved file count exceeds the effective limit.

### Correct usage

```js
// ✅ Good — single package, limited files
collab_debug(["packages/core/src/agents/**/*.ts"])

// ✅ Dynamic — limit computed from contextWindow
collab_debug({
// ✅ Explicit — override limit directly
collab_debug({
  targetPaths: ["packages/core/src/**/*.ts"],
  maxTargetFiles: 15,
})

// ✅ Dynamic — limit computed from contextWindow
collab_debug({
  targetPaths: ["packages/core/src/**/*.ts"],
  contextWindow: 100_000,  // → limit = floor(100000 * 0.4 / 2000) = 20
})

// ❌ Bad — entire monorepo
collab_debug(["packages/**/src/**/*.ts"])
```

### For large codebases

Run **package-by-package** or **module-by-module** sessions. Target only the area under review, not the whole repo.
