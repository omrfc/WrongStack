/**
 * Build the steering preamble that gets prepended to a user's message
 * after they pressed Esc to interrupt the agent. The preamble carries
 * three things the model would otherwise have to infer:
 *
 *   1. Context — exactly what was in flight (tool calls, subagents,
 *      partial assistant text). Without this the model rationalizes
 *      from chat scrollback and often resumes the prior task by
 *      accident.
 *   2. Authority — a short, explicit list of what the model is
 *      allowed to do (abandon the prior plan, respawn fresh
 *      subagents, ask for clarification). Models hedge unless they
 *      believe they have permission to pivot hard.
 *   3. New direction — the user's actual instruction, fenced off.
 *
 * The block is user-role plain text. We deliberately don't use a
 * system role here — the human triggered this, so accountability
 * stays with their turn and the model can challenge / clarify
 * without violating role separation.
 *
 * Exported for the steering test that pins the contract.
