/**
 * PR 5c of Phase 2: extract the `shell.open` WS message handler into
 * a unit-testable helper. The CLI's `runWebUI` and the standalone
 * `startWebUI` both had near-identical 49-line inlined copies with
 * a metacharacter guard + cross-platform spawn chain, this test
 * pins the helper's contract so the two call sites can't drift
 * again.
 *
 * The helper spawns child processes. We never assert that a window
 * actually appears (we're not testing xterm); we only assert the
 * result shape and the metacharacter guard, plus the existence
 * check. The spawn path is covered by the existing
 * open-browser.test.ts style integration (no new browser test
 * here, the existing flow works in CI).
