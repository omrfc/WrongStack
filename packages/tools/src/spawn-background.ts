/**
 * spawn-background — platform-independent background process spawning.
 *
 * Provides truly fire-and-forget background process execution that:
 *   - Works consistently on Windows and POSIX
 *   - Does not block the parent Node.js event loop
 *   - Creates a fully independent child process (new process group/session)
 *   - Does NOT register with the ProcessRegistry (fire-and-forget)
 *   - Does NOT affect the circuit breaker
 *
 * POSIX: Uses setsid() (detached: true) to create a new session, fully
 *        detaching from the parent's process group. The child becomes a
 *        daemon-like process.
 *
 * Windows: detached: false + windowsHide: true (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). This is
 *          deliberate: CreateProcess IGNORES CREATE_NO_WINDOW when combined
 *          with DETACHED_PROCESS (which detached: true sets), so a detached
 *          cmd.exe runs console-less and its console-app *grandchildren*
 *          (node, etc.) each allocate a fresh VISIBLE console window.
 *          CREATE_NO_WINDOW instead gives the child a hidden console that
 *          grandchildren inherit — no window ever appears. Windows children
 *          survive parent exit regardless of detached, and the hidden
 *          console also isolates them from the terminal's Ctrl+C, so
 *          nothing is lost by dropping DETACHED_PROCESS.
