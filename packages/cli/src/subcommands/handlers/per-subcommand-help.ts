/**
 * Per-subcommand help block.
 *
 * Each subcommand handler in `packages/cli/src/subcommands/handlers/`
 * that wants a focused `--help` block exports its help data through
 * this module. The handler invokes `renderFocusedHelp(name, renderer)`
 * at the top of its dispatch (after the `--help` short-circuit check)
 * to print the per-subcommand block and return 0.
 *
 * Why a single module:
 *   - **Single source of truth.** All per-subcommand help lives in
 *     one place; the bypass infrastructure in `cli-main.ts` just
 *     falls through to the dispatcher, and each subcommand handler
 *     imports the right helper from here.
 *   - **No circular import risk.** The handlers don't import each
 *     other — they all import from this module.
 *   - **Testable in isolation.** Pure data + a pure render function
 *     — the test suite pins the help text byte-for-byte.
 *
 * Note on `resume`: `wstack resume` is a slash command (`/resume`)
 * invoked from inside the REPL, not a top-level subcommand. The
 * `/resume` slash command has its own help rendering in
 * `slash-commands/resume.ts` — it's intentionally NOT a key in
 * this table. (The user's prompt listed it alongside the other
 * subcommands; the disambiguation lives here.)
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Four help surfaces that must stay in sync
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * For every entry in the top-level `helpTable` AND every entry in
 * the `deepHelpTable`, the user can invoke `--help` / `-h` from
 * four different surfaces, all of which MUST produce the same
 * string:
 *
 *   1. `wstack <sub> --help`           (top-level CLI bypass)
 *   2. `wstack <sub> <deep> --help`    (deep-subcommand CLI bypass)
 *   3. `/<slash> <sub> [deep] help`    (in-REPL slash command)
 *   4. `/help <sub> [deep]`            (in-REPL dispatch help)
 *
 * The four surfaces read from the SAME data structures (this
 * module's `helpTable` + `deepHelpTable`) and the SAME renderer
 * functions (`renderFocusedHelp` / `renderDeepHelp`). Adding a
 * new flag or a new subcommand entry to this file updates all
 * four surfaces simultaneously — drift between them is
 * structurally impossible.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The `customBody` delegation pattern
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The standard `PerSubcommandHelp` layout (title / description /
 * usage / subcommands / seeAlso) covers ~95% of the help surface.
 * For the remaining ~5% — deep-help entries whose help text is
 * large, column-aligned, or has its own closing "see also" / "Examples"
 * lines (e.g. a multi-row flag table) — the standard layout is
 * too rigid. The `customBody?: () => string` field is the
 * escape hatch:
 *
 *   - When set, `renderBlockToString(help)` returns the function's
 *     output **verbatim** — the standard title / usage /
 *     subcommands / seeAlso scaffolding is skipped.
 *   - The caller owns the full layout, including the title line
 *     and any closing lines.
 *   - The `title` / `description` / `usage` / `subcommands` /
 *     `seeAlso` fields are still required by the `PerSubcommandHelp`
 *     type but are **not rendered** (the `customBody` function
 *     owns the full block). They're filled in with sensible
 *     defaults so a future refactor that drops `customBody` (e.g.
 *     to use the standard layout) still has a coherent fallback.
 *
 * **When to use `customBody`**: a deep-help entry whose help text
 * is already maintained by a dedicated module elsewhere in the
 * codebase, and that module exports a string-returning renderer.
 * The canonical example is `auth:local`, which delegates to
 * `packages/cli/src/subcommands/handlers/auth-local-help.ts`'s
 * `renderAuthLocalHelpToString()`. The flag list lives in
 * `LOCAL_AUTH_FLAGS` in exactly one place; every surface that
 * renders the help reads from it. Drift is structurally
 * impossible.
 *
 * **When NOT to use `customBody`**: a help block that fits the
 * standard layout (a title, a description, a usage line, an
 * optional subcommands table, an optional see-also). The standard
 * layout is the default — `customBody` is a last resort, used only
 * when the standard layout doesn't fit (e.g. a multi-row flag
 * table with column alignment, a list of aliases, an Examples
 * block). Adding `customBody` for a block that fits the standard
 * layout creates visual inconsistency (customBody blocks don't
 * get the standard `Tip: \`wstack --help\` lists every top-level
 * command.` footer).
 *
 * **How to add a new delegated entry** (worked example):
 *
 *   Suppose you're adding `wstack plugin official --help` (a
 *   hypothetical help block for the curated plugin registry).
 *   The flag list is small enough for the standard layout, BUT
 *   you also want a closing "Examples" block that the standard
 *   layout doesn't support. The right move is:
 *
 *     1. Create `packages/cli/src/subcommands/handlers/plugin-official-help.ts`:
 *
 *        ```ts
 *        // Single source of truth for the `wstack plugin official` flag list.
 *        const OFFICIAL_HELP_FLAGS: ReadonlyArray<{ flag: string; description: string }> = [
 *          { flag: '--include-source', description: 'Include the source URL in the output.' },
 *          { flag: '--json',          description: 'Emit the registry as JSON (default: table).' },
 *        ];
 *
 *        export function renderPluginOfficialHelpToString(): string {
 *          // ... build the block (title + description + usage + flag table + Examples) ...
 *          return lines.join('\n') + '\n';
 *        }
 *
 *        export function renderPluginOfficialHelp(renderer: TerminalRenderer): void {
 *          renderer.write(renderPluginOfficialHelpToString());
 *        }
 *        ```
 *
 *     2. Add the entry to the `deepHelpTable` in this file:
 *
 *        ```ts
 *        'plugin:official': {
 *          name: 'plugin:official',
 *          title: 'wstack plugin official — list the curated official registry',
 *          description: 'Print every plugin in the official registry. Each row shows the alias (for shorthand on the command line) and the full NPM specifier.',
 *          usage: 'wstack plugin official [--include-source] [--json]',
 *          seeAlso: 'wstack plugin list (the configured set)',
 *          customBody: renderPluginOfficialHelpToString,
 *        },
 *        ```
 *
 *     3. The new deep-help entry is automatically reachable from
 *        all four surfaces:
 *          - `wstack plugin official --help`
 *          - `/plugin official help` (if a `/plugin` slash exists)
 *          - `/help plugin official` (the two-token dispatch form)
 *          - the existing `wstack plugin` top-level entry's
 *            `Subcommands` table can mention `official` and the
 *            help will resolve when the user asks
 *            `wstack plugin official --help`.
 *
 *     4. Add a test in `per-subcommand-help.test.ts` (the deep-help
 *        suite) and a smoke test in `slash-commands.test.ts` (the
 *        dispatch test) — see the existing `auth:local` tests for
 *        the pattern.
 *
 * **Single source of truth contract**: when `customBody` is set,
 * the function MUST be the only place the body is generated. The
 * `auth-local-help.ts` module is the canonical example: the flag
 * list lives in `LOCAL_AUTH_FLAGS`, and `renderAuthLocalHelpToString`
 * is the only function that formats it. A future contributor who
 * adds a parallel flag array elsewhere breaks the contract; the
 * type system doesn't catch it, but the existing
 * "delegates to auth-local-help.ts (single source of truth)" test
 * would fail (it does `expect(deepOut).toBe(localHelpOut)` —
 * byte-for-byte equality).
 *
 * **Why `customBody` is a thunk, not a value**: the function is
 * called lazily, inside `renderBlockToString`. This matters
 * because:
 *   - Tests that import the data table (e.g. for the "every entry
 *     has a non-empty title" test) don't trigger the lazy
 *     evaluation. If `customBody` were a `string`, importing the
 *     table would force the body to be built.
 *   - The thunk can call back into a module that imports
 *     `PerSubcommandHelp` (e.g. `auth-local-help.ts` itself imports
 *     from this file via `renderFocusedHelpToString`'s chain). A
 *     `string` value would be evaluated at module-load time, when
 *     the import cycle hasn't resolved yet.
 *
 * In short: `customBody` is a *delegate*, not a *value*. The data
 * table stays pure data; the rendering is lazy.

/**
 * Focused help for *deep* subcommands — `wstack <top> <deep> --help`.
 *
 * Each entry is keyed by `"<top>:<deep>"` (e.g. `"mcp:add"`,
 * `"models:remove"`). The handler for the top-level subcommand
 * (`mcpCmd`, `modelsCmd`, etc.) does a one-line lookup before its
 * top-level help short-circuit:
 *
 *   ```ts
 *   if (args.includes('--help') || args.includes('-h')) {
 *     if (args[0] && args[1] && renderDeepHelp(`${args[0]}:${args[1]}`, deps.renderer)) {
 *       return 0;
 *     }
 *     if (renderFocusedHelp('mcp', deps.renderer)) return 0;
 *   }
 *   ```
 *
 * Why a separate table from `helpTable`:
 *   - The two tables have different lookup keys (single string vs.
 *     `<top>:<deep>`) and would otherwise need a polymorphic
 *     discriminator on every read.
 *   - Deep subcommand help is a *level below* the top-level help;
 *     the top-level entry still points at the deep subcommand via
 *     the `Subcommands` table, and the deep entry is the detail
 *     page the user gets when they ask for help on the deep one.
 *   - A future contributor can add a deep help entry without
 *     touching the top-level entry — the two are independent.
 *
 * Only deep subcommands that have meaningful flags (beyond what
 * the top-level help already describes) get entries. Trivial
 * deep subcommands like `mcp list` or `config show` don't — the
 * top-level help already tells the user everything they need.
