/**
 * Single-instance mailbox-bridge lock.
 *
 * Per-project isolation: each project (resolved via
 * `resolveProjectDir`) gets its own lock file under
 * `<projectDir>/.mailbox-bridge.lock`. Two projects on the same
 * machine never collide — different slugs, different lock files,
 * and (with default port 0) different OS-assigned ports.
 *
 * The lock holds:
 *  - pid          process id of the owning `wstack mailbox serve`
 *  - host, port   what the owner actually bound (port may be OS-assigned)
 *  - url          convenience copy for callers
 *  - token        the bearer token (so external agents don't have to
 *                 re-read it from .mailbox.token separately)
 *  - generation   monotonically increasing counter; bumped on every
 *                 acquire. Lets a release() call identify whether the
 *                 current lock file still belongs to *this* process
 *                 (e.g. after a stale cleanup raced with us).
 *  - spawnedAt    ISO timestamp — for observability, not load-bearing.
 *
 * Concurrency model:
 *  - `acquireOrJoin` is atomic via rename(2). Two concurrent spawns
 *    race to write a tmpfile then rename; one wins, the other reads
 *    the winner's lock and joins.
 *  - PID liveness is checked via `process.kill(pid, 0)` (POSIX) or
 *    `tasklist` (Windows). A live PID means another instance owns
 *    this project; a dead PID means the lock is stale and gets cleaned.
 *  - `release` is best-effort: a missing lock file at shutdown is
 *    fine (someone else already took over). A generation mismatch means
 *    we lost the race and another instance owns it now — also fine.
 *
 * Token persistence: the token in the lock matches the token in
 * `.mailbox.token`. External agents that read either get the same
 * value. On a fresh `wstack mailbox serve` the token is regenerated
 * and BOTH files are updated atomically; a restarting owner keeps
 * the same token across restarts (no longer rotates on every start).
 * This lets external agents survive a bridge restart without having
 * to re-discover credentials.
