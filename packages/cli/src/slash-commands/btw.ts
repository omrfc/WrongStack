 * Stashes a short note on the live run context. Unlike `/steer` (which aborts
 * the iteration and prepends a heavy STEERING preamble), `/btw` lets the agent
 * keep working and folds the note in at the start of its next iteration —
 * between tool batches. If no run is active, the note rides along on the next
 * turn the agent takes.
