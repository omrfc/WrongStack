/**
 * Slash-command deep help — mirrors the per-subcommand-help table
 * for slash commands that correspond to top-level subcommands.
 *
 * Why this module exists:
 *   - `/help <slash>` should render the same block as `wstack <sub> --help`
 *     so the in-REPL and the top-level surfaces can't drift.
 *   - `/<slash> <deep> help` (or `/<slash> <deep> --help` or `-h`) should
 *     render the same block as `wstack <slash> <deep> --help`.
 *   - The `SlashCommand.help` field is the *inline* short form (e.g.
 *     `/mcp` lists the subcommands inline); the per-subcommand-help
 *     table is the *focused* long form. Both can coexist, but the
 *     focused form wins for the `help` request.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   - `slashToSubcommand` maps slash names to their top-level subcommand
 *     counterpart. Slash commands that have no top-level mirror
 *     (e.g. `/btw`, `/collab`, `/interrupt`) are *not* in this map —
 *     they fall back to the inline `help` field.
 *   - `renderSlashFocusedHelp(slash)` looks up the slash's top-level
 *     counterpart and renders the focused help block as a string.
 *     Returns `undefined` when the slash has no top-level mirror
 *     (callers fall through to the inline `help` field).
 *   - `renderSlashDeepHelp(slash, deep)` renders the deep help
 *     block for the given slash + deep subcommand. Returns
 *     `undefined` when no `<top>:<deep>` entry exists.
 *   - `wantsDeepHelp(args)` returns true when the last token in
 *     `args` is `help`, `--help`, or `-h` — the standard pattern
 *     for "show me help for the previous subcommand".
 *
 * The dispatcher functions are pure (no side effects on the
 * renderer) so the slash command can return the rendered string
 * as `{ message }` directly, matching the `SlashCommand.run`
 * contract.

/**
 * Slash command → top-level subcommand counterpart.
 *
 * The map is split into two sections:
 *
 *   - **Existing slash commands** — slash commands that are
 *     already registered in the REPL. Each entry is a real
 *     binding: a slash command named `auth` exists in
 *     `packages/cli/src/slash-commands/auth.ts`, and the
 *     entry here makes `/help auth` and `/auth help` render
 *     the same string `wstack auth --help` would write.
 *
 *   - **Forward-compatible bindings** — slash commands that
 *     DON'T exist yet but likely will. Each entry pre-registers
 *     a mapping so that when a future contributor adds e.g.
 *     `packages/cli/src/slash-commands/config.ts` with
 *     `name: 'config'`, the focused-help wiring "just works"
 *     without needing to remember to update this file.
 *
 * Only slash commands that have a clean `wstack <name>` mirror
 * belong in this map. Slash commands that have no top-level
 * surface (e.g. `/btw`, `/interrupt`, `/fleet`) are intentionally
 * absent — they fall through to the inline `help` field.
 *
 * Aliases: the slash command's `aliases` field is also looked up
 * at call time, so a slash command with `aliases: ['plugins']`
 * will resolve via both `'plugin'` and `'plugins'`.

  // for `/help <name>` to render the same block `wstack <name> --help`
  // would write. The contributor still has to add the
  // `wantsDeepHelp` / focused-help short-circuit to the new slash
  // command's `run()` method (mirroring the pattern in
  // `auth.ts` / `mcp.ts` / etc.) — this map just registers the
  // dispatch target for the existing `/help <name>` renderer.
  //
  // Adding an entry here is a one-line, type-checked change.
  // There's no runtime cost when the slash command doesn't exist
  // yet — `renderSlashFocusedHelp` only fires when the user types
  // `/help <name>`, and if the slash command isn't registered,
  // the existing inline-help path is the fallback.
