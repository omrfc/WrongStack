// PR 5 of Issue #29: extract the SystemPromptBuilder container
// binding (the block that runs after `resolveModeAndCapabilities()`
// returns and before the tool registry is built) into a
// dedicated helper.
//
// Why this split:
//
//   - The 48-line inline block is one of the largest
//     contiguous pieces of main() that doesn't need access
//     to anything except the container and a handful of
//     forward-declared refs (autonomyModeRef, sessionRef).
//     Lifting the binding into a helper means readers can
//     scan main() and see "the system prompt is wired here"
//     instead of having to read 48 lines of contributor
//     factories to find the same conclusion.
//
//   - The `autonomyModeRef` / `sessionRef` forward
//     declarations are an *intentional* two-step pattern:
//     the contributor factories read from a ref because the
//     refs are mutated later in main() (autonomy engine
//     setup, session bring-up) and the contributor needs
//     the *current* value, not a snapshot. The helper's
//     signature pins that contract: callers pass the
//     ref-shapes in, the helper doesn't own them.
//
//   - The closure over `wpaths` (used to compute
//     `planPath` and `goalPath`) means a refactor of
//     `wpaths`'s shape would otherwise require touching
//     main(). Pulling the wiring into a helper that takes
//     a `paths: SystemPromptBuilderPaths` argument means a
//     `wpaths` shape change is a single touchpoint.
//
//   - The helper is unit-testable: the bind closure is
//     pure (no async, no process state) so the test can
//     mock the container's `bind` and assert that the
//     builder is constructed with the right contributor
//     set, the right `modeId`/`modePrompt` props, and the
//     right `planPath` callback.
//
// Why this helper does *not* use core's `Container` /
// `MemoryStore` / `ModeStore` / `SkillLoader` types as
// direct dependencies:
//
//   - The CLI's main() has historically been the
//     canary-call-site for breaking changes in those
//     types. By declaring local `InterfaceX` placeholders
//     (see below) we ensure this helper has zero
//     compile-time coupling to the core type names, and
//     can be re-pointed at runtime by changing only the
//     call site in main(). The unit test exercises the
//     helper with fakes that satisfy the local interfaces.
