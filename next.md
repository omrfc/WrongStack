# Next Up

Carry-over work for the next session. Items are ordered by ROI
(impact-to-effort ratio, eyeballed). Each entry has a one-line "why"
and the smallest concrete next step so a future agent (or me
tomorrow) can pick it up without re-deriving context.

Last updated: 2026-06-03 (end of a 22-commit day, ~18h).

## 1. CLI / WebUI boot path unification — HIGH ✅ DONE (2026-06-03)

**Done.** Canonical `bootConfig(opts?: BootConfigOptions)` now lives in
`packages/core/src/infrastructure/boot.ts` (exported from the core barrel).
It does path resolution, the AES-GCM `DefaultSecretVault`, plaintext-secret
migration (label via `appLabel`: `wstack` vs `WebUI`), config + sync load,
project-meta write, and logger creation — the union of what cli/webui each
did. `packages/cli/src/boot-config.ts` and `packages/webui/src/server/boot.ts`
are now thin wrappers that re-shape the result into their legacy return types.
Behavior coverage moved to `packages/core/tests/infrastructure/boot.test.ts`;
the cli `boot-config.test.ts` (real core, temp HOME) and a slimmed webui
`boot.test.ts` (wrapper contract) round it out. 17 tests green; core/cli/webui
typecheck + build clean.

<details><summary>Original note</summary>

**Why.** `packages/cli/src/boot-config.ts` and
`packages/webui/src/server/boot.ts` are near-duplicates. Both:
- resolve wpaths via `DefaultPathResolver` + `resolveWstackPaths`
- create a real `DefaultSecretVault` (AES-GCM, not XOR)
- call `migratePlaintextSecrets` over `[globalConfig, projectLocalConfig]`
- print a `[wstack]/[WebUI] Encrypted N plaintext secret(s) in FILE`
  notice (now via `writeErr` after the Phase 5 cleanup)
- load config via `DefaultConfigLoader` + build a `DefaultLogger`

The drift already shows: cli has `ensureProjectMeta(wpaths, projectRoot)`;
webui has explicit `fs.mkdir(... recursive: true)` for the same three
paths. Either copy of that logic can fall behind when a new wpath is
added.

**Effort.** 2–3h. One repo, two consumers, one canonical core helper.

**Next step.** Add `bootConfig(flags?: Record<string, string|boolean>)`
to `packages/core/src/runtime/boot.ts` (or `infrastructure/boot.ts` —
pick whichever the architectural review has fewer cycles through) that
takes the `flags?` shape cli uses and returns `{ config, vault,
globalConfigPath, projectRoot, wpaths, logger }`. Both packages then
re-export it from their own `boot.ts` for backward compatibility. Keep
the per-package `bootConfig()` signature as a thin pass-through.

**Refs.** Audit report `04-architecture-refactoring.md` §5.5 (LOW
priority there, but the duplicated surface is the actual issue);
`packages/cli/src/boot-config.ts:36-58` and
`packages/webui/src/server/boot.ts:30-63` are the two near-duplicate
implementations.

## 2. webui/src/server/index.ts — remaining concerns

**Progress.** `index.ts` is now **1923 lines** (it had grown to 2046).
`http-server.ts` (#17), **`ws-auth.ts` (#6), `lifecycle.ts` (#18), and
`token-estimator.ts` (#7) are extracted**.

| # | Concern | Status | Migration cost |
|---|---------|--------|---------------:|
| 17 | `http-server.ts` — static serve, MIME, CSP, SPA fallback | ✅ done (`5200966`) | LOW |
| 6  | `ws-auth.ts` — token check, time-constant compare, DNS-rebinding | ✅ done (2026-06-03) | LOW |
| 18 | `lifecycle.ts` — graceful shutdown + SIGINT/SIGTERM | ✅ done (2026-06-03) | LOW |
| 7  | `token-estimator.ts` — per-section context.debug token breakdown | ✅ done (2026-06-03) | LOW |
| 11 | `error-formatter.ts` — ⚠️ plan mismatch (see below) | re-scope | LOW |
| 9  | `rest-routes.ts` — `/api/...` registration | open | MEDIUM |
| 8  | `ws-handlers.ts` — `handleMessage` switch on `type` | open | HIGH (shared state) |

**token-estimator.ts done (2026-06-03).** Extracted the `context.debug`
per-section token breakdown (~78 lines) into pure `estimateTokens` /
`stringifyContent` / `estimateContextBreakdown` in
`packages/webui/src/server/token-estimator.ts`; the WS handler now calls it and
layers `mode`/`policy` on top. New `token-estimator.test.ts` (7 tests, incl. the
per-block-type accounting + preview truncation). Note: faithful extraction —
the original (and the extract) assume `tool_use` blocks always carry an `input`
(`JSON.stringify(undefined)` would throw); real blocks always do. Full webui
suite 144 green; index.ts diff verified content-only (no biome reformat).

**#11 error-formatter — plan mismatch.** The sub-agent plan called this
"JSON-RPC error shape", but the webui server speaks a WebSocket broadcast
protocol (`{ type: 'error', payload }`), not JSON-RPC. The only real
duplication is `err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err)` repeated
~10×. If actioned, it's a one-line `errMessage(err)` helper (+ maybe a
`sendError(ws, phase, err)` wrapper), NOT a ~40-line module. Re-scope or drop.

**lifecycle.ts done (2026-06-03).** Extracted the inline `shutdown` closure +
`process.on('SIGINT'/'SIGTERM')` into `packages/webui/src/server/lifecycle.ts`
(`createShutdown` + `registerShutdownHandlers`) with injectable `log`/`exit`
seams, so the teardown order, error-swallow, and idempotency are unit-testable
without killing the runner. `index.ts` passes a `flushSession` thunk + a
`clients()` getter (closes whoever is connected *at signal time*) + the server
list. Added a re-entrancy guard (rapid double Ctrl+C no longer runs teardown
twice) — minor behavior improvement. New `lifecycle.test.ts` (6 tests); full
webui suite 137 green; typecheck + build clean.

**ws-auth.ts done (2026-06-03).** Extracted the inline `verifyClient`/
`isLoopback`/`tokenMatches`/`hostHeaderOk` closures (~73 lines) into pure,
documented functions in `packages/webui/src/server/ws-auth.ts`; `index.ts`
keeps a thin adapter that pulls fields off the request and delegates (dropped
the now-unused `timingSafeEqual` import). Crucially, `ws-auth.test.ts` no longer
re-implements a simplified copy — it imports the **real** functions, and the
DNS-rebinding guard (`hostHeaderOk`) + constant-time `tokenMatches`, which had
**zero** real-code coverage, are now tested. 15 → **24 ws-auth tests**; full
webui suite 131 green; typecheck + build clean.

> Note: `ws-auth.test.ts` still carries local copies of `isPathSafe` and the
> rate limiter (separate concerns). `isPathSafe` is now redundant with
> `http-server.ts`'s exported `isInsideDist` — repoint it when #8's rate-limiter
> lands, or as a tiny standalone cleanup.

**Next step.** All four LOW entries are done. What remains is MEDIUM/HIGH:
`rest-routes.ts` (#9, ~150 lines) then `ws-handlers.ts` (#8, ~400 lines, touches
shared `clients`/`session`/`context` state — the hard one). Both are 4–6h and
warrant their own session. The #11 "error-formatter" is a tiny `errMessage()`
helper, not a module — do it opportunistically or drop.

**IMPORTANT (process).** Do NOT `biome --write` `index.ts` (or other
pre-existing committed files) — they aren't biome-clean at HEAD and `--write`
reformats the whole file into a multi-thousand-line noise diff. Use targeted
edits; `--write` only files you create whole. Verify with
`git diff --shortstat` vs `--ignore-all-space` (should match).

**Refs.** Commits `5200966` (http-server) and the ws-auth / lifecycle /
token-estimator extractions above show the exact pattern.

## 3. Phase 6: input-reader readLine + readSecret tests — ✅ DONE (2026-06-03)

**Done.** Added `packages/cli/tests/input-reader-line-secret.test.ts` (9
tests): `readLine` via a `node:readline` mock (entered line, default `> `
prompt, Ctrl+C/EOF close → empty, history persistence) and `readSecret` via a
fake TTY stdin + `process.stdout.write` spy (bullet masking, DEL backspace,
Ctrl+U clear-line, raw-mode restore + stdin pause, non-TTY → readLine
fallback). Every reader uses a throwaway temp `historyFile` so tests never
touch the real `~/.wrongstack/history`. Original readKey test header updated to
point at the new file. 13 input-reader tests green; cli typecheck clean.

<details><summary>Original note</summary>

**Why.** `packages/cli/tests/input-reader.test.ts` (commit `3fe3bc8`)
covers `readKey` (4 tests). The other two methods on the same
reader are uncovered:

- `readLine` uses `readline.createInterface` and prompts a free-form
  string. Mocking requires faking the interface and a writable tty.
- `readSecret` toggles raw mode, accumulates bytes, prints bullets,
  and restores mode on Enter / Ctrl+C. The mask-then-restore dance
  is the exact kind of thing a future refactor will quietly break.

**Effort.** 1–1.5h (mostly the `readSecret` mask harness).

**Next step.** For `readLine`: stand in for stdin with the same fake
`EventEmitter`-based stream used by the readKey test, then resolve
`rl.question` directly (export a `createReadline` shim so the test
can supply its own readline). For `readSecret`: assert on
`process.stdout.write` capture (the bullets are routed through
`writeOut` after Phase 4) and verify the post-Enter raw-mode restore.

**Refs.** `packages/cli/src/input-reader.ts:140-180` (readSecret
implementation), the existing readKey test for the fake-stdin pattern.

## 4. `process.stdout.write(` in docs — ⚠️ PREMISE INVALID, recommend close

**Reassessed 2026-06-03.** Inspected all three sites; none is a
WrongStack output site that should adopt `writeOut`, so the original
"trains contributors to copy the old pattern" rationale doesn't hold:

- `packages/mcp/README.md:178,184` — inside a **"Writing Your Own MCP
  Server"** standalone stdio example. Those writes ARE the JSON-RPC
  protocol channel; they must stay `process.stdout.write` (+`flush`).
  The example server doesn't import `@wrongstack/core` and shouldn't.
  Changing these would be actively wrong.
- `packages/core/skills/node-modern/SKILL.md:144` — a generic
  **"Web Streams"** teaching snippet (read a `fetch` body, print the
  decoded chunk). It teaches Node stream mechanics, not WrongStack
  output conventions; a `writeOut` import would muddy a generic lesson.
- `packages/providers/README.md:52` — a `provider.stream()` usage
  example printing text deltas. Borderline, but it documents using
  `@wrongstack/providers` standalone; `writeOut` (a core export) isn't
  necessarily in scope for a providers consumer, and `process.stdout.write`
  is the idiomatic "print streamed tokens" form.

**Recommendation.** Close this item. If we still want the teaching
win, the right move is a one-line note in the *contributing* docs that
`writeOut` is the seam for first-party CLI output — not edits to these
three third-party/standalone examples.

## 5. Re-run the audit-log triage sub-agent

**Why.** The last audit delegation timed out at 10 minutes. The
manual grep for the M1/M2/M3 batch (`02-bug-hunt-tools-cli.md`)
showed all three were already fixed in the current code, but that
was a quick scan — there are still 4 reports
(`03-security-audit.md`, `04-architecture-refactoring.md`,
`05-dependency-package-health.md`, `08-extensibility-configurability-audit.md`)
that may have open MEDIUM items I didn't fully triage.

**Effort.** 1h (sub-agent dispatch + review).

**Next step.** Re-dispatch the audit-log role with the same task
description as before, but give it 25 minutes (`timeoutMs: 1_500_000`)
and `maxIterations: 80` instead of the default 10-minute / 30-iter
budget. The previous attempt spent 13 iterations reading 8 files in
parallel and was about to start writing the report when it hit the
timeout. Read its findings, file the open MEDs into a follow-up
section of this `next.md`, and pick at most 2 to action this week
(rest are deferred to a planned hardening sprint).

**Refs.** `.reports/02-bug-hunt-tools-cli.md` lines 100-150 for the
M-series format that's now clean (good template for the new
findings).

---

## 6. bun.lock format diff

**Why.** Mentioned earlier in the day but not acted on — likely a
benign CRLF / ordering difference from whoever last ran `bun install`
in CI. Worth a one-line fix to keep the diff surface small.

**Effort.** 5 minutes (or zero, if it's just a regenerate).

**Next step.** Run `bun install` and commit the resulting
`bun.lock` if it changed. If the diff is the same after a
regenerate, it was a toolchain artifact — close the item.

---

## Deferred (out of scope for next session)

- Decompose `cli/src/index.ts` further — 130 lines already came out
  in commit `5d2595e`, but 1,310 lines still remain. The next
  biggest extraction candidates are the slash-command registration
  loops and the JSONL-result emit. Both are MEDIUM-risk; budget a
  half-day when there's a clear consumer for the extracted function.
- MEDIUM-severity findings in `.reports/03-security-audit.md:109`
  and `.reports/04-architecture-refactoring.md:157` — pull these
  once the audit-log sub-agent (item 5) finishes its re-triage.
- Replace `process.env['PORT']` reads with a typed `env` helper —
  sprinkled through 8+ files, no risk, ~1h, but only worth doing
  alongside item 1 (boot unification reuses the same env-reading
  pattern).
